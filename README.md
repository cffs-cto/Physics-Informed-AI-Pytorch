# Physics-Informed-AI-Pytorch
A collection of examples in which Physics-Informed-AI is used to solve Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). All the code is implemented in Pytorch.

This repo will be (incrementally) polulated with the following examples:
* Physics-Informed-Neural-Networks (PINNs);
* parametric PINNS;
* standard (i.e. data-driven-only) Neural Operators, such as DeepONet and Fuourier Neural Operator (FNO)
* Physics-informed Neural Operators (PI-DeepONet, PI-NO)
